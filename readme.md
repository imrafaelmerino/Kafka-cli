## <a name="intro"><a/> Introduction

Kafka CLI is a powerful command-line interface tool designed to simplify and enhance your
interaction with Apache Kafka. Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, is widely used for building
real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. However, managing Kafka producers and
consumers, as well as publishing messages, can be complex and time-consuming. Kafka CLI addresses
these challenges by providing an easy-to-use interface for performing common Kafka tasks.

### Why Use Kafka CLI?

- **Ease of Use**: Kafka CLI simplifies the process of starting, stopping, and listing Kafka
  producers and consumers. It abstracts the complexity of Kafka’s configurations and operations,
  allowing you to focus on your core tasks.

- **Flexibility**: The CLI supports multiple producers and consumers with different configurations,
  making it easy to experiment and tailor your Kafka setup to specific requirements. Whether you
  need different serializers, retry configurations, or specific topic subscriptions, Kafka CLI has
  you covered.

- **Experimentation**: Kafka CLI encourages experimentation by allowing you to quickly set up and
  test different configurations. This is particularly useful for development and testing
  environments where you need to iterate rapidly and understand how different settings affect your
  Kafka setup.

- **Customizable Data Generation**: With built-in support for customizable data generators, you can
  easily publish both generated and custom messages to Kafka topics. This feature is essential for
  simulating various scenarios and testing the robustness of your Kafka-based applications.

- **Session Logging**: Every command and its output can be automatically logged to a session file
  (if specified), providing an audit trail and making it easier to debug and review your operations.

- **Extensibility**: Since it's developed in Java, it is extremely easy to add custom and complex
  commands to Kafka CLI.

## <a name="conf"><a/> Configuration File

The configuration file provided is just an example to illustrate how the Kafka CLI works. You can
customize it to fit your needs by adding any number of consumers, channels, and producers, each with
their own configurations. This flexibility allows you to tailor the CLI tool to your specific Kafka
setup and requirements.

### `conf` Section

This section includes general configuration settings for the CLI tool. All the fields in the `conf`
section are optional.

- **aliases**: Defines shortcuts for commands. For example, instead of typing `producer-start`, you
  can use the alias `ps`.

- **welcome_message**: The message displayed when the CLI is started.

- **session_file_dir**: Directory where session files are stored. Each time the CLI is started, a
  new session file is created and all the commands typed by the user and their outputs will be
  dumped into that file.

- **colors**: Defines color codes for different types of messages using ANSI escape codes. These
  codes are used to control the formatting, color, and other output options on text terminals.

    - **Error Messages**: `\u001B[0;31m` - Sets the text color to red.
    - **Result Messages**: `\u001B[0;34m` - Sets the text color to blue.
    - **Prompt Messages**: `\u001B[0;32m` - Sets the text color to green.

  These codes are prefixed with `\u001B` (which represents the escape character) followed by `[`,
  and then the color code (e.g., `0;31m` for red). Here’s a breakdown of the codes:

    - `0` indicates the default text style.
    - `31` sets the text color to red.
    - `34` sets the text color to blue.
    - `32` sets the text color to green.

### `kafka` Section

This section is mandatory and includes configuration settings related to Kafka. It is recommended to
use just one producer, as this is the most efficient way of publishing to Kafka. Only create
different producers when you need different configurations (e.g., different serializers or retry
configurations).

#### General Kafka Properties

The common Kafka properties specified under `props` will be added to all the consumers and
producers, providing a convenient way to avoid repeating the same properties multiple times in the
configuration file. For example, you always have to specify the servers.
You may need some additional general properties for secure communication and authentication between Kafka clients,
brokers, and the schema registry.
Find an example in this [configuration file](kafka-cli-template/conf1.json)

#### Consumers

Configuration for Kafka consumers.

- `topics`: List of topics the consumer subscribes to.
- `pollTimeoutSec`: Poll timeout in seconds.
- `props`: Properties specific to each consumer, such as deserializers, offset reset policy, and
  group ID. When using Avro to serialize data, you must use the deserializers from
  [avro-spec](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/avro-spec), as shown in `consumer1`:
  ```json
  "key.deserializer": "jsonvalues.spec.deserializers.confluent.ConfluentDeserializer",
  "value.deserializer": "jsonvalues.spec.deserializers.confluent.ConfluentDeserializer"
  ```

#### Producers

Configuration for Kafka producers.

- `props`: Properties specific to each producer, such as serializers, acknowledgments, timeouts,
  and linger settings. When using Avro to serialize data, you must use the serializers from
  [avro-spec](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/avro-spec), as shown in `producer1`:
  ```json
  "key.serializer": "jsonvalues.spec.serializers.confluent.ConfluentSerializer",
  "value.serializer": "jsonvalues.spec.serializers.confluent.ConfluentSerializer"
  ```

#### `channels` Section

This section defines channels, which are logical groupings that link producers to topics and define
schemas and generators for keys and values. Generators specified in the channels are necessary to

use the `producer-publish` command, which uses them to generate the data.

- **producer**: The name of the producer associated with this channel.
- **topic**: The Kafka topic this channel publishes to.
- **key-generator**: The generator used for the keys. This field needs to be specified if you want
  to use the `producer-publish` command, as the command uses the generator to produce the data.
- **value-generator**: The generator used for the values. This field needs to be specified if you
  want to use the `producer-publish` command, as the command uses the generator to produce the data.
- **key-schema**: The Avro schema for the keys.
- **value-schema**: The Avro schema for the values.

### Summary

This configuration file allows you to set up and manage your Kafka CLI tool effectively by defining
shortcuts, message formats, Kafka properties, consumer and producer settings, and channels linking
producers to topics with appropriate schemas and generators. Remember, it's best to use a single
producer for efficiency unless different configurations are necessary. For Avro data, use the
serializers and deserializers from [avro-spec](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/avro-spec),
otherwise you'll get an error.

## <a name="starting-the-cli"><a/> Starting the CLI

To start the CLI, you can use the provided Maven project [`kafka-cli-template`](kafka-cli-template).

### Step 1: Edit the `pom.xml` File

Edit the [`pom.xml`](kafka-cli-template/pom.xml) file to specify the main class you have to create.
For example:

```xml

<mainClass>com.example.cli.MyCLI</mainClass>

```

### Step 2: Create the Main Class

Create a main class, such as `MyCLI`, that initializes the Kafka CLI with the necessary generators.
Below is an example of what this class might look like:

```java
package com.example.cli;

import com.github.imrafaelmerino.kafkacli.KafkaCLI;
import fun.gen.*;
import jsonvalues.*;

import java.util.*;

public class MyCLI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Gen<?>> generators = new HashMap<>();
        generators.put("keyGen",
                       JsObjGen.of("_id",
                                   JsStrGen.alphabetic()));
        generators.put("valueGen",
                       JsObjGen.of("a",
                                   JsIntGen.arbitrary(0, 1000),
                                   "b",
                                   JsStrGen.alphabetic(),
                                   "c",
                                   JsStrGen.alphabetic()));
        generators.put("textGen",
                       StrGen.alphabetic(10, 100));

        new KafkaCLI(generators).start(args);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the generators specified in the configuration file (`keyGen`, `valueGen`, and
`textGen`) must be created and used to instantiate the `KafkaCLI` object.

### Step 3: Execute the Maven Command

To start the CLI, execute the following Maven command:

```sh
mvn exec:java
```

### Notes

You can edit the [`pom.xml`](kafka-cli-template/pom.xml) file to change the path of the
configuration file and the log4j file where the Kafka client dumps its log entries. For example:

```xml

<arguments>
    <argument>${project.basedir}/conf.json</argument>
</arguments>

<systemProperties>
<systemProperty>
    <key>log4jFilePath</key>
    <value>${project.basedir}/.kafka.log</value>
</systemProperty>
</systemProperties>
```

This configuration specifies that the CLI will use `conf.json` for its configuration and
`.kafka.log` for logging.

## <a name="examples"><a/> Useful Examples

Here's a useful script example that demonstrates how to automate a series of Kafka CLI commands
using a script file.

### Script File Example

Create a script file named `my_publisher.jio` with the following contents:

```plaintext
producer-start producer2
producer-publish 2
last every 100 for 10000
producer-stop producer2
```

This script will:

1. Start the producer named `producer2`.
2. Publish a generated message using the channel named `2`.
3. Repeat the last command (which is `producer-publish 2`) every 100 milliseconds for a total
   duration of 10000 ms (10 seconds).
4. Stop the producer named `producer2`.

### Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command in kafka-cli:

```sh
~ script ${DIR_PATH}/my_publisher.jio
```

This will execute all the commands in `my_publisher.jio` sequentially, automating the process and saving
you time.

This example demonstrates how you can leverage the Kafka CLI to automate common tasks, making it a
powerful tool for managing your Kafka setup efficiently.
